## Project Description
In January 2020, disaster struck, and the first case of the corona virus (COVID-19) was registrered outside the point of origin in Wuhan, China. It became apparent the current availbility of air travel had enabled an exponential spread of the deadly respiratory virus. As a direct response to contain the virus the German airline Lufthansa decreased the flights with 95% from the 19th of March.

Studies suggest that the aviation industry is responsible for 2.4% of the total greenhouse gas emission [Graver, Zhang, Rutherford](https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/ICCT_CO2-commercl-aviation-2018_20190918.pdf). 

## Questions & Hypotheses
Following the extreme decline in air traffic, it seems interesting to make a correlation study, trying to prove/disporve the following hypothesis:

** The aviation industry plays a major role in the total emission of greenhouse gasses on planet earth. This would suggest that the decrease in air traffic has caused a lower pollution level in general.
